    "Script": "Hey SpaceSecrets fans! Did you know the Hubble Space Telescope is now operating on its last legs? After years of capturing the universe's wonders, one of its three remaining gyros failed, and NASA decided to run Hubble on just one gyro to extend its life. This means Hubble can't move between targets as quickly, and a big part of the sky is now off-limits. But don't worry, NASA's confident Hubble can keep going into the mid-2030s, even with these limitations. And there's talk of a private mission to give Hubble a boost. Stay tuned to see how this space legend keeps pushing the boundaries of our universe!",
