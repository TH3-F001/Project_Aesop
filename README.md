# Welcome to Project Aesop 🌟

Hey there! Thanks for swinging by Project Aesop. Ya found me in the early stages, but I'm as excited as a squirrel with a fresh acorn about what's coming up!

## 🤔 What’s Project Aesop All About?
Project Aesop is all about automating the creation and posting of YouTube videos, especially those nifty little shorts. But hey, if you’re feeling adventurous, you can tweak it to churn out longer videos too. We’re mainly using Python and JSON, and we’re tinkering with some pretty slick Generative AI APIs like OpenAI and ElevenLabs.

### 🌠 Features (Coming Real Soon!)
- **Automated Video Creation**: Just feed it some ChatGPT prompts and your own sprinkle of creativity with user-defined data, and voilà!
- **Scheduled Posts**: Set it and forget it! You can schedule videos to post daily.
- **On-Demand Posts**: Need a video out now? Just push the button.
- **GUI and TUI**: We’re putting together both graphical and text-based interfaces to make it easy-peasy whether you're a mouse person or a keyboard cowboy.
- **Manage Multiple Google Accounts**: Got a bunch of Google accounts? Perfect! Rotate 'em to stay within YouTube's posting limits.

### 📈 Current Status
- We’re still mixin’ the batter for this project, so things aren’t quite ready to roll out of the oven yet.

### 🤝 How to Get Involved
Want to help out? That’s mighty kind of ya! Check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how you can lend a hand.

### ⚙️ Setting Up
We'll be cooking up a detailed setup guide soon. Stay tuned for instructions on how to get everything running smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy.

### 🔑 API Keys
You’ll need to fetch your own keys for:
- **OpenAI**
- **ElevenLabs**
- **Google**
- **Redit**
- **NewsAPI**
- Potentially more as we expand

Just grab the keys for the APIs you plan to work with. And remember, depending on what part of the project you’re dancing with, you might not need any keys at all!

## 💬 Stay in Touch
I'm as eager as a kid on Christmas morning to see where this can go. Keep your eyes peeled as we keep building and improving. Any questions or got a bright idea? Don't hesitate to reach out or pull up a chair and contribute.

Thanks for stopping by, and we can't wait to see what we'll create together with Project Aesop!
